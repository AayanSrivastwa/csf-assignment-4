# Development Process

## 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Installed Python on the system.
- Installed and opened Visual Studio Code.
- Created a new folder named **Assignment-4**.
- Opened the folder in VS Code and created the main program file `Calculator.py`.

## 2. Writing the Program
- Started by printing a menu for the user.
- Added basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Added a simple check to avoid division by zero.
- Tested the program multiple times to ensure correct output.

## 3. Initializing Git
- Opened the terminal inside VS Code.
- Ran `git init` to start version control.
- Made the first commit with the project files.

## 4. Creating the `.gitignore`
- Added `.vscode/` and Python cache files to ignore unnecessary files.
- Committed the `.gitignore` file.

## 5. Uploading to GitHub
- Created a new repository on GitHub.
- Added the repo link using `git remote add origin ...`
- Pushed all files using `git push`.
- Confirmed that all files appeared correctly on GitHub.

## 6. Documentation
- Created a docs folder.
- Wrote project overview, development process, and future improvements.

This development workflow helped me understand how real projects are created, documented, and uploaded on GitHub.
